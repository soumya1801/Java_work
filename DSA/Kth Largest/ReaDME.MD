Find kth Largest Element in a Stream
Given an infinite stream of integers, find the kth largest element at any point in time.
Hint: If you keep the stream sorted somehow at all times, it becomes easier to detect the kth largest number at any given point in time.

 

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer ‘N’ as the size of the stream.

The second line contains an integer ‘K’ representing the position of the largest number.

The third line contains elements of the stream of size ‘N’.

 

Output Format:

The output contains the kth largest number at any point in time. If the kth largest number does not exist, then print ‘None’ (without quotes and with capital letter ‘N’). 

 

Sample Test Cases:

Input:

8

3

20 30 21 80 60 50 110 15

 

Output:

None

None

3 largest number is 20

3 largest number is 21

3 largest number is 30

3 largest number is 50

3 largest number is 60

3 largest number is 60
