Given an array of integers, find the most frequent element in the array. If multiple elements appear a maximum number of times, print any one of them. Return -1 in case there are no elements.

 

Sample input 1:
5
7 8 9 4 9

Sample output 1:
9

This is because out of the elements [7 8 9 4 9], 9 is the only one which occurs the maximum no. of times (twice)

 

Sample input 2:
0

Sample output 2:
-1

This is because no elements are there over which the function may be called, hence we return -1
